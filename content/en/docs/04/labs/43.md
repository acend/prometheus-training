### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Deploy a database and use a sidecar container to expose metric

**Task description**:

As we've learned in [Lab 4 - Prometheus exporters](../../../04/) when applications do not expose metrics in the Prometheus format, there are a lot of exporters available to convert metrics into the correct format. In Kubernetes this is often done by deploying so called sidecar containers along with the actual application.

Use the following file to deploy a MariaDB database:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

This will create a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) (username password to access the database), a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and the [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

* Deploy the [mariadb exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) from <https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter/> as a sidecar container
  * Alter the existing MariaDB deployment definition to contain the side car
* Create a ServiceMonitor to instruct Prometheus to scrape the sidecar container

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

First we need to alter the deployment of the MariaDB with adding the MariaDB exporter as a second container.
Then extend the service by adding a second port for the MariaDB exporter.

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-sidecar.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

Then we also need to create a new ServiceMonitor:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/targets). Target name: `TODO/mariadb/0` (It may take up to a minute for Prometheus to load the new configuration and
scrape the metrics).
