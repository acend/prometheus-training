### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Deploy a database and use a sidecar container to expose metric TODO: references etc etc

**Task description**:

As we've learned in [Lab 4 - Prometheus exporters](../../../04/) when applications do not expose metrics in the Prometheus format, there are a lot of exporters available to convert metrics into the correct format. In Kubernetes this is often done by deploying so called sidecar containers along with the actual application.

Use the following command to deploy a MariaDB database in the `application-metrics` namespace.

```bash
curl -o ~/work/mariadb.yaml \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acend/prometheus-training/main/content/en/docs/01/labs/mariadb.yaml
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml
```

This will create a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) (username password to access the database), a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and the [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

* Deploy the [mariadb exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) from <https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter/> as a sidecar container
  * Alter the existing MariaDB deployment definition (~/work/mariadb.yaml) to contain the side car
  * Apply your changes to the cluster with `{{% param cliToolName %}} -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml`
* Create a ServiceMonitor to instruct Prometheus to scrape the sidecar container

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

First we need to alter the deployment of the MariaDB with adding the MariaDB exporter as a second container.
Then extend the service by adding a second port for the MariaDB exporter.

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-sidecar.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

We can apply the file above using:

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/mariadb.yaml
```

Then we also need to create a new ServiceMonitor `~/work/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml`.

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n application-metrics apply -f ~/work/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml
```

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/targets). Target name: `application-metrics/mariadb/0` (It may take up to a minute for Prometheus to load the new configuration and
scrape the metrics).
