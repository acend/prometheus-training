### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Deploy a database and use a sidecar container to expose metric

As we've learned in [Lab 4 - Prometheus exporters](../../../04/) when applications do not expose metrics in the Prometheus format, there are a lot of exporters available to convert metrics into the correct format. In Kubernetes this is often done by deploying so called sidecar containers along with the actual application.

This lab demonstrates that with a `mariadb` database. In the first step, we are going to install a plain `mariadb` with a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) (username password to access the database), a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and the [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

Create the following three files with the corresponding filenames and content:

`user-demo/mariadb-secret.yaml`:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-secret.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

`user-demo/mariadb-init-deployment.yaml`:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-init-deployment.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

`user-demo/mariadb-init-service.yaml`:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-init-service.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

Add, commit and push the changes to your git repository and ArgoCD will deploy the `mariadb`.

This will create a [Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) (username password to access the database), a [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) and the [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

MariaDB is not able to expose prometheus metrics out of the box, we need to deploy the [mariadb exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter) from <https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter/> as a sidecar container

For that we must alter the existing MariaDB deployment and service definition to contain the side car.

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-deployment.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/mariadb-service.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

Then we also need to create a new ServiceMonitor (`user-demo/mariadb-servicemonitor.yaml`) to instruct Prometheus to scrape the sidecar container on the given port:

{{< readfile file="/content/en/docs/04/labs/servicemonitor-sidecar.yaml" code="true" lang="yaml" >}}

Verify that the target gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/targets). Target name: `serviceMonitor/<user>/mariadb/0` (It may take up to two minutes for Prometheus to load the new configuration and
scrape the metrics).


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: (Optional) Explore mariadb Metrics

Explore the newly added metrics using the following PromQL Query:

```promql
{job="mariadb"}
```

Import the [mariadb dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/14621-mysql-mariadb-workload/) and explore how those metrics can be used.
