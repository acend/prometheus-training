### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Memory usage of Prometheus

**Task description**:

* Display the memory usage of both Prometheus pods
* Use a filter to just display metrics from your `prometheus` containers

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

Use the [Thanos Querier web UI](https://{{% param thanosquerier %}} to execute the queries.

{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}


{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
Search for a metric with `memory_working_set` in its name
{{% /alert %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}
{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

```promql
container_memory_working_set_bytes{pod=~"prometheus-prometheus-0", container="prometheus",namespace=~"<user>.*"}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}
{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

```promql
container_memory_working_set_bytes{namespace="<user>-monitoring", pod=~"prometheus-prometheus-.*", container="prometheus"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Kubernetes pod count

**Task description**:

* Display how many pods are currently running on your Kubernetes platform

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

There are different ways to archive this. You can for example query all running containers and group them by `pod` and `namespace`.

```promql
count(sum(kube_pod_container_status_running == 1) by (pod,namespace,cluster))
```

You may also sum() all running pods on your Kubernetes nodes

```promql
sum(kubelet_running_pods)
```

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
The result counts only the pods on the clusters that you actually use. Therefore, this number may be different for each monitoring stack.
There may be a minor discrepancy between the two options, as the platform is constantly changing and different jobs query the targets at different times.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Display metrics in Kubernetes Grafana

Let's try to inspect some cluster metrics in Grafana. Of course we could build our dashboard from scratch again and feel free to try, but in most cases there will always be someone who has already built a dashboard for your purpose. As we already have seen grafana has a searchable [dashboard database](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/) to get prebuilt dashboards from. Currently we are interested in resource usage of our kubernetes namespace.

**Task description**:

* Open and copy the id or json of the [Kubernetes / Views / Namespaces](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/15758-kubernetes-views-namespaces/) dashboard
* Navigate to your [Kubernetes Grafana](http://{{% param grafanaUrl %}})
* Create a new dashboard in your Grafana instance and choose 'Import'
* Paste the Json or Id from the dashboard and choose 'thanos-querier' as your datasource

Inspect the dashboard for your namespace `<user>`, you will find metrics and visualizations for most important metrics. You can inspect and edit panels for your purpose.
