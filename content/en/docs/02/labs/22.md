In this lab you are going to explore various metrics, which your Prometheus server is collecting.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Prometheus/Thanos web UI

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

As we have now attached the Thanos Querier to your own Prometheus as well as the infrastructure Prometheus, we will use its UI to have a global view.

{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

As we have multiple Prometheus instances, we will use the Thanos Querier to query metrics on our Prometheus instances running on different clusters. To get an overview of the how Thanos fits into the picture, check out the diagram in [Confluence](https://confluence.baloisenet.com/display/BALMATE/Application+Monitoring)

{{% /onlyWhen %}}

Get a feel for how to use the Thanos Querier web UI. Open the [web UI](https://{{% param thanosquerier %}}) and navigate to the **Graph** menu (right on top in the grey navigation bar next to Stores).

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

![Thanos UI](../thanos-ui.png)

Let's start and find a memory related metric. The best way to start is by typing `node_memory` in the expression bar.

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
As soon as you start typing a dropdown with matching metrics is shown.
{{% /alert %}}

Select a metric such as `node_memory_MemFree_bytes` and click the `Execute` button.

The result of your first Query will be available under the two tabs:

1. Table
2. Graph

Explore those two views on your results. Shrink the time range in the Graph tab.

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2: Metric Prometheus server version

Prometheus collects its own metrics, so information such as the current build version of your Prometheus server is displayed as a metric.

Let's find a metric that shows you the version of your Prometheus server.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

Start typing `prometheus_...` in the expression browser, choose the `prometheus_build_info` metric and click the `Execute` Button.

Something similar to the following will be displayed

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
Sice we have two Prometheus Servers connected to our querier, there will be two results

```promql
prometheus_build_info{branch="HEAD", container="prometheus", endpoint="http-web", goarch="amd64", goos="linux", goversion="go1.21.0", instance="10.244.18.50:9090", job="kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus", namespace="monitoring", pod="prometheus-kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus-0", prometheus="monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus", revision="efa34a5840661c29c2e362efa76bc3a70dccb335", service="kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus", tags="netgo,builtinassets,stringlabels", version="2.47.0"}
prometheus_build_info{branch="HEAD", container="prometheus", endpoint="web", goarch="amd64", goos="linux", goversion="go1.21.0", instance="10.244.12.41:9090", job="prometheus-operated", namespace="user6-monitoring", pod="prometheus-prometheus-0", prometheus="monitoring/kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus", revision="efa34a5840661c29c2e362efa76bc3a70dccb335", service="prometheus-operated", tags="netgo,builtinassets,stringlabels", version="2.47.0"}
```

The actual Version of your Prometheus Server will be available as label `version`
```promql
{version="2.47.0"}
```
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
prometheus_build_info{branch="HEAD", cluster="caasi01", container="prometheus-proxy", endpoint="web", goversion="go1.18.4", instance="172.16.2.103:9093", job="prometheus", monitoringselector="clustermonitoring", namespace="ch-application-security-monitoring", pod="prometheus-prometheus-0", prometheus="config-caasi01-monitoring/prometheus", revision="b41e0750abf5cc18d8233161560731de05199330", service="prometheus", version="2.37.0"}
...
```

The actual Version of your Prometheus Server will be available as label `version`
```promql
{version="2.37.0"}
```
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3: Metric TCP sockets

Let's explore a `node exporter` metric in this lab.

1. Find a metric that shows you the number of TCP sockets in use
1. Display the number 5 minutes ago
1. Display the numbers in a graph over the last 15 minutes


{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The node exporter metrics are all available in the `node` [namespace](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#metric-names).

The number of TCP sockets in use are available in the following metric.

```promql
node_sockstat_TCP_inuse
```

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

You can select a specific time series by filtering by the `instance` label.

```promql
node_sockstat_TCP_inuse{instance="prometheus-training.balgroupit.com:9100"}
```

{{% /onlyWhen %}}


If you want to display the value 5 minutes ago, you'll have to add the correct timestamp in the **Evaluation time** field.

Switch to the **Graph** tab and change the value of the timepicker from `1h` to `15m` to display the graph over the last 15 minutes.

{{% /details %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4: Metric network interfaces

Most virtual Linux machines nowadays have network interfaces. The `node exporter` you have enabled and configured in the previous lab also exposes metrics about network components.

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}
Show all disk devices where the device name starts with `sd`
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}


{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
Show all network interfaces where the device name starts with `ens`
{{% /onlyWhen %}}

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The network interfaces are available in the following series:

```promql
node_network_info
```

The result includes all sorts of network interface. If you need to **filter** the result by a label you will have to alter your query:

{{% onlyWhenNot baloise %}}

```promql
node_disk_filesystem_info{device="sdc"}
```
But this will only show results for the exact `sdc` device. The Task was to show all interfaces that start with `sd`.
{{% /onlyWhenNot %}}


{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}
```promql
node_network_info{device="ens192"}
```
But this will only show results for the exact `ens192` interface. The Task was to show all interfaces that start with `ens192`.
{{% /onlyWhen %}}


In this case we have to use [Time series Selectors](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/#time-series-selectors) to create a matching filter:

```promql
node_disk_filesystem_info{device=~"sd.*"}
```

There will be a lot more about queries and filtering in the next Labs

{{% /details %}}

{{% onlyWhen baloise %}}

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5: CMDB monitoring (optional)

If your team does not use virtual machines, you can skip this task.

As soon as a virtual machine is defined in the [CMDB](https://oim.baloisenet.com), it is added to the monitoring stack using the defined business services. These servers are monitored automatically with generally defined alerts. To check if there are already some machines being monitored by the monitoring stack, navigate to **your teams** Thanos. Your example monitoring stack will obviously not have these targets configured.

* Use the selector `managed="cmdb-service-asset"` and the metric `up`.

{{% details title="Hints" mode-switcher="normalexpertmode" %}}

The servers can be listed using the following series:

```promql
up{managed="cmdb-service-asset"}
```

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}
You may not be using virtual machines and therefore the list is empty.
{{% /alert %}}

{{% /onlyWhen %}}
