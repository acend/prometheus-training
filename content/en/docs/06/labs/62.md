### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1: Troubleshooting Kubernetes Service Discovery TODO: rewrite

We will now deploy an application with an error in the monitoring configration.

* Deploy [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) in the loki namespace

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} create ns loki
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki create deployment loki \
--image=mirror.gcr.io/grafana/loki:latest
```

* Create a Service for Loki

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki create -f \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/prometheus-training/main/content/en/docs/01/labs/service-loki.yaml
```

* Create the Loki ServiceMonitor

```bash
{{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki create -f \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puzzle/prometheus-training/main/content/en/docs/01/labs/servicemonitor-loki.yaml
```

* When you visit the [Prometheus user interface](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/targets) you will notice, that the Prometheus Server does not scrape metrics from Loki. Try to find out why.

{{% alert title="Troubleshooting: Prometheus is not scrapping metrics" color="primary" %}}
The cause that Prometheus is not able to scrape metrics is usually one of the following.

* The configuration defined in the ServiceMonitor does not appear in the Prometheus scrape configuration
  * Check if the label of your ServiceMonitor matches the label defined in the `serviceMonitorSelector` field of the Prometheus custom resource
  * Check the Prometheus operator logs for errors (Permission issues or invalid ServiceMonitors)
* The Endpoint appears in the Prometheus scrape config but not under targets.
  * The namespaceSelector in the ServiceMonitor does not match the namespace of your app
  * The label selector does not match the Service of your app
  * The port name does not match the Service of your app
* The Endpoint appears as a Prometheus target, but no data gets scraped
  * The application does not provide metrics under the correct path and port
  * Networking issues
  * Authentication required, but not configured

The quickest way to do this is to follow the instructions in the info box above. So let's first find out which of the following statements apply to us

* The configuration defined in the ServiceMonitor does not appear in the Prometheus scrape configuration
  * Let's check if Prometheus reads the configuration defined in the ServiceMonitor resource. To do so navigate to [Prometheus configuration](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/config) and search if `loki` appears in the scrape_configuration. You should find a job with the name `serviceMonitor/loki/loki/0`, therefore this should not be the issue in this case.
* The Endpoint appears in the [Prometheus configuration](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/config) but not under targets.
  * The namespaceSelector in the ServiceMonitor does not match the namespace of your app
  * The label selector does not match the Service of your app
  * The port name does not match the Service of your app
* The Endpoint appears as a Prometheus target, but no data gets scraped
  * The application does not provide metrics under the correct path and port
  * Networking issues
  * Authentication required, but not configured

  * Lets check if the application is running
    ```bash
    {{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki get pod
    ```
    The output should be similar to the following:
    ```bash
    NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    loki-5846d87f4c-tthsr   1/1     Running   0          34m
    ```
  * Lets check if the application is exposing metrics
    ```bash
    PODNAME=$({{% param cliToolName %}} get pod -n loki -l app=loki -o name)
    {{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki exec $PODNAME -it -- wget -O - localhost:3100/metrics
    ...
    ```
  * The application exposes metrics and Prometheus generated the configuration according to the defined servicemonitor. Let's verify, if the ServiceMonitor matches the Service.
    ```bash
    {{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki get svc loki -o yaml
    ```

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      ...
      labels:
        app: loki
      name: loki
      namespace: loki
    spec:
      ...
      ports:
      - name: http
        ...
    ```
    We see that the Service has the port named `http` and the label `app: loki` set. Let's check the ServiceMonitor
    ```bash
    {{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki get servicemonitor loki -o yaml
    ```

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
    kind: ServiceMonitor
    ...
    spec:
      endpoints:
      - interval: 30s
        ...
        port: http
        ...
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          prometheus-monitoring: "true"
    ```
    We see that the ServiceMonitor expect the port named `http` and a label `prometheus-monitoring: "true"` set. So the culprit is the missing label. Let's set the label on the Service.
    ```bash
    {{% param cliToolName %}} -n loki label svc loki prometheus-monitoring=true
    ```

    Verify that the target now gets scraped in the [Prometheus user interface](http://{{% param replacePlaceholder.k8sPrometheus %}}/targets).
